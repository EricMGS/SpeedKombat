## About
SpeedKombat is a simple game of squares.   
You need to control the movements of the blue square to catch the black square 20 times.  
Seems easy? So **I challenge you to try**.  
Each time you collect the black square your speed is doubled, making the game more and more difficult.  
The more you play the greater the challenge for your motor coordination ... and for your patience. :laughing:
